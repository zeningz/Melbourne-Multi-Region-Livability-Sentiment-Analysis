    "abstract": "This dataset presents details of buildings works approved in Australia for the 2017-2018 financial year. The data has been aggregated and presented by Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) 2016 boundaries.<br/><br/>\n\nStatistics of building work approved are compiled from: permits issued by local government authorities and other principal certifying authorities; contracts let or day labour work authorised by commonwealth, state, semi-government and local government authorities; and major building approvals in areas not subject to normal administrative approval e.g. building on remote mine sites.<br/><br/>\n\nThe scope of the collection comprises the following: construction of new buildings; alterations and additions to existing buildings; approved non-structural renovation and refurbishment work; and approved installation of integral building fixtures. The statistics include all approved residential building valued at $10,000 or more and all approved non-residential building valued at $50,000 or more.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/8731.0Explanatory%20Notes1Jul%202018?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Explanatory Notes</a>.<br/><br/> <ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the original data from the ABS.</li>\n<li>The data has been sourced from the July 2018 release.</li>\n</ul>",
